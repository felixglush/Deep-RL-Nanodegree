# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, I trained an agent to navigate and collect bananas in a large, square world. The file `dqn_agent.py` contains the definition of the Agent along with a ReplayBuffer that it uses to sample previous experiences during learning. `model.py` defines a QNetwork that is used to create a function approximator for the action-values. Actions are chosen following an epsilon-greedy policy with epsilon linearly annealed by 0.995 from 1.0 to 0.01 after each episode during training. 

Trained network weights are saved in `checkpoint.pt`.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of my agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started
1. Follow the instructions in this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) to set up the dependencies required for the project. Note that for this project, you can skip the OpenAI installation. All you need to do is create a conda environment, activate it, then `pip install .` from the python directory of the above repo.

2. Download the Unity environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system. Note the Linux environment is included in this repository:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

3. Place the file in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip the file. If a different environment from the one included is used, be sure to change the file name appropriately when instantiating the environment: `env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="...")`

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in `Navigation.ipynb` for a brief introduction to interacting with the agent and environment. See `Solution.ipynb` for a fully trained agent.
